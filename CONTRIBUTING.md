## Instructions for CCAdmins:

Before contribute make sure relevant main folder is being added if not then create a folder and then inside that folder create subfolders for each class according to structure proposed below

- Folder Structure :

  - For adding class material

        YYYY_MM_DD_CLASS-NAME


- CLASS-NAME can be, but not exhaustively limited to, one of the following :
  - Git
  - MachineLearning
  - Competitive_programming

Please refrain from using spaces anywhere in file/folder names. Use underscores, dashes or CamelCasing.

In subfolders for each class upload all the material like ppts, code snipets & extra.
Create a .md file for that folder and add content and links of the resources in that in a redeable format

Please avoid providing redundant file formats for the same content. Stick to popular formats like .ipynb for python code, pdf for documents and so on.
